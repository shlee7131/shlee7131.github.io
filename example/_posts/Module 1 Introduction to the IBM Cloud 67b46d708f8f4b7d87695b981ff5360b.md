# Module 1 - Introduction to the IBM Cloud

# IBM Cloud Overview

The IBM Cloud is a range of offerings and services from IBM covering all aspects of cloud computing to allow you to leverage the cloud resources where and how you want.

- Hybrid cloud

    Hybrid cloud is  where a business wants to leverage their own data center resources, both infrastructure and private cloud, as well as a public cloud. IBM Cloud can **securely deliver the private cloud and services** needed to create and mange a hybrid cloud

- Multi cloud

    Multi cloud is where a business wants to spread their IT across multiple clouds, public and private to get the required levels of privacy, security and resilience, avoiding a single vendor lock-in. However, adopting a multi-cloud approach introduces many challenges around the management and interoperability of applications and services. IBM Cloud can help with offerings such as multi-cloud management, where applications and services spanning multiple clouds can be managed through a single console
